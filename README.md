# Dialysis-Clinic-Analysis

The repository contains the code for the stacked bar graphs (financial sentiment analysis data) which represent the net revenue of all the dialysis clinics in CA before and after the salary for an average physician is deducted. 

The graph was coded in Python using the Pandas library. 

The data presented above shows us the possible effect of Proposition 29 on clinics. This was calculated by using data for the span of 20 years, from 2002 till 2021. The data that was collected was the number of clinics, the physiciansâ€™ salaries, the net profit of clinics across California, and the total expenses of the dialysis clinics. With this data, we extracted information about how many clinics, overall, were at profit/loss before the expense of an added physician to the clinic versus after, based on their average salary. After graphing the extracted data, we can see that the percentage of clinics in loss will increase and likewise, the percent of clinics in profit will decrease. Therefore, an added physician at each and every clinic will increase its expenses which can potentially result in expensive dialysis treatments or the shutdown of clinics. However, we also need to take in limitations of our data. Our data analysis only considers physicians; however, nurse practitioners and other medical professionals are also included in the proposition. As they may have reduced salaries compared to physicians, less clinics may be at a loss after adding a medical professional if we consider non-physicians.
